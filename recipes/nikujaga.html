    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese style meat and potatoes! More text goes here just to take up space and look like a paragraph wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Despite the fact that I put more words here it still does not look like a paragraph. This recipe is borrowed from AllRecipes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 snow peas</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 pound sirloin steak, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 potatoes, cut into bite sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups dashi soup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the snow peas in a small saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook the beef in the oil until browned. Add the potatoes; cook and stir until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the dashi soup, soy sauce, sake, and sugar into the mixture; simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and scatter the chopped onion over the mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid is nearly completely evaporated, about 15 minutes more. Top the mixture with the snow peas to serve.</li>
    </ol>
